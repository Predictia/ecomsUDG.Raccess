#' Performs the aggregation of 6 hourly data to daily mean
#' 
#' This is an auxiliary routine used in \code{\link{toDD}} within the \code{makeSubset} functions
#' 
#' @param x a vector of data (a time series actually)
#' @details The function assumes that we are loading 6-h data so that the length of x is always divisible by 4.
#' Otherwise it will raise an error. Because selections are based on seasons and years, there is no reason that this error
#'  ever occurs unless we are taking the previous forecast time for deaccumulation purposes (but so far there is not any
#'  de-accumulable 6h variable, and it is not likely that one is ever going to come across any...). 
#' @return The vector aggregated by the mean of each four elements
